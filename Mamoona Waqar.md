Question 1 
Difference between Agile and DevOps
Agile is a software development model which brings together the stakeholders and developers to provide software releases quickly. It encourages collaboration and customer feedback. Agile works on small iterations and provides transparency to stakeholders. In agile some planning is done initially and then small iterations of project development are carried, and a running version of project is released in a shorter duration. Agile mainly repeat the process of design, develop, test, deploy and review until the project is launched. DevOps is based on agile but brings development and operations together to provide continuous releases. DevOps combines continuous integration and continuous delivery/deployment. Continuous cycle of DevOps wraps around plan, code, build, test, release, deploy, operate and monitor.
