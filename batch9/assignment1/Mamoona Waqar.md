**Question 1**
Difference between Agile and DevOps 
Agile is a software development model which brings together the stakeholders and developers to provide software releases quickly. It encourages collaboration and customer feedback. Agile works on small iterations and provides transparency to stakeholders. In agile some planning is done initially and then small iterations of project development are carried, and a running version of project is released in a shorter duration. Agile mainly repeat the process of design, develop, test, deploy and review until the project is launched. DevOps is based on agile but brings development and operations together to provide continuous releases. DevOps combines continuous integration and continuous delivery/deployment. Continuous cycle of DevOps wraps around plan, code, build, test, release, deploy, operate and monitor.
**Question 2** 
Define CI, Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment 
Continuous integration refers to continuously merging code into central repository, resulting in automated builds and automated testing. Continuous delivery takes continuous integration to a further step by creating an automated software release but deployment to production is done manually. In continuous deployment everything is automated from integration to deployment to production.
**Question 3** 
Benefits of Cloud Computing 
Cloud computing provides you with the whole setup of enivornment where you dont need to manage yourself. Cloud computing is easily scalable according to the needs. Easy access from anywhere in the world.
**Question 4** 
Difference between git and github 
Git is a version control system which keeps tracks of changes in source code during development while github is a web-based git repository hosting service. It also offers all the distributed version control services and source code management of Git adding some of its own functionality.
